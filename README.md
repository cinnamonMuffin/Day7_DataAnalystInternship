# Day7_DataAnalystInternship

For this task, I used Jupyter Notebook to connect Python to SQL. I then created a new sales table with initial contents. Then I printed a summary and other information like Total quantity and Total Revenue.
After that, I plotted a bar chart showing Revenue by Product.
I have attached the notebook, the database and the bar chart image.

Thank you.
